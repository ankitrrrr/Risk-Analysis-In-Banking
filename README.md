##  Banking Risk Analytics Dashboard & EDA Project
# Project Overview

This project focuses on risk analytics in the banking and financial services sector to minimize financial loss while lending money to customers. The project combines Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python and interactive dashboards using Power BI to analyze customer profiles, loan behavior, and banking engagement. The insights help banks make informed and data-driven loan approval decisions.

🎯 Problem Statement

Banks face high risk when lending money without proper analysis of customer profiles. The challenge is to understand customer behavior, financial patterns, and risk indicators to decide whether a loan applicant is likely to repay the loan.

💡 Solution

The solution involves:

Performing EDA using Python to understand data patterns and relationships

Cleaning and transforming data for accuracy

Creating Power BI dashboards to visualize KPIs and trends

Helping stakeholders assess customer risk profiles efficiently

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains banking and client-related information stored across multiple interconnected tables using primary and foreign keys.

Tables Used:

Banking Relationship

Clients – Banking

Gender

Investment Advisor

Period

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Python (EDA)

Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Seaborn – Statistical and advanced visualizations

BI & Analytics

Power BI – Dashboard creation and reporting

DAX – Measures and KPIs

Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation

🧹 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Handled missing and inconsistent values

Created Engagement Timeframe to track client duration in banks

Calculated Engagement Days using date difference

Created Income Bands (Low, Mid) based on estimated income

Generated Processing Fees based on fee structure

Optimized data model for analysis

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to:

Analyze distribution of loans, deposits, and fees

Identify patterns in customer engagement

Compare loan amounts across gender and income bands

Detect trends, outliers, and correlations

Understand customer behavior before dashboard creation
