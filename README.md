# Banking Risk Analytics Dashboard & EDA Project
## Project Overview

This project focuses on risk analytics in the banking and financial services sector to minimize financial loss while lending money to customers. The project combines Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python and interactive dashboards using Power BI to analyze customer profiles, loan behavior, and banking engagement. The insights help banks make informed and data-driven loan approval decisions.

## Problem Statement

Banks face high risk when lending money without proper analysis of customer profiles. The challenge is to understand customer behavior, financial patterns, and risk indicators to decide whether a loan applicant is likely to repay the loan.

## Solution

The solution involves:

- Performing EDA using Python to understand data patterns and relationships

- Cleaning and transforming data for accuracy

- Creating Power BI dashboards to visualize KPIs and trends

- Helping stakeholders assess customer risk profiles efficiently

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains banking and client-related information stored across multiple interconnected tables using primary and foreign keys.

##Tables Used:

-> Banking Relationship
-> Clients – Banking
-> Gender
-> Investment Advisor
-> Period

# Tools & Technologies
## Python (EDA)
Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib – Data visualization
Seaborn – Statistical and advanced visualizations

## BI & Analytics

## Power BI – Dashboard creation and reporting
DAX – Measures and KPIs
Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-> EDA was performed using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to:
-> Analyze distribution of loans, deposits, and fees
-> Identify patterns in customer engagement
-> Compare loan amounts across gender and income bands
-> Detect trends, outliers, and correlations
-> Understand customer behavior before dashboard creation

## DAX & Analytical Functions Used

-> SUM – Aggregate numeric values

-> DISTINCTCOUNT – Count unique clients

-> SUMX – Row-level calculations

-> SWITCH – Conditional logic

-> DATEDIFF – Engagement duration calculation

## Key KPIs

-> Total Clients
-> Total Loan
-> Bank Loan
-> Business Lending
-> Total Deposit
-> Total Fees
-> Credit Card Balance
-> Savings & Checking Account Amounts
-> Foreign Currency Account
-> Engagement Length

## Dashboards & Visualizations

Home Dashboard – Overall banking overview

Loan Analysis Dashboard – Risk and loan distribution

Deposit Analysis Dashboard – Deposit trends

Summary Dashboard – Consolidated KPIs and insights

## Business Impact

-> Reduces lending risk

-> Improves loan approval accuracy

-> Enhances decision-making efficiency

P-> rovides transparency into banking operations
